While hiding from Norman, Breloom jumps out

Wally is found out and scolded

Norman uses Slaking Swagger to try and get Ruby, but is protected from confusion by Kiki

Norman just leaves after, but Wally has collapsed on the floor (???, he just leaves him there)

Ruby brings him to his home, and they prepare to sneak out at night
