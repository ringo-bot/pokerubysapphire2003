Torchic uses ember on Nana, Birch lets Ruby use Mudkip
    - Ruby cannot find a trait he likes in it for pokemon contests
    - Sapphire knocks away Mudkip and Birch realizes its his daughter

Seviper appears
    - Ruby does not want to help as his pokemon will gain too much xp and lose their cuteness
    - Sapphire beats the Seviper

Sapphire makes a bet with Ruby to beat all the gyms and him get all the contest badges in 80 days

She faints afterwards as she took a hit from Mightyena
    - Ruby patches her wounds
    - He off screens the Seviper with his pokemon and Mudkip is shocked

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We are introduced to Sapphire and she has the leaf clothing outfit, which will appear later on in the story
    - There should be a way to allow the character to have multiple outfits

- Have the first rival battle here?
    - Mudkip vs Torchic
    - Torchic/Mudkip vs Seviper (?) (double battle?)
        - there will be a lot more double battles in the story
        - humans also participate in battle a lot, what mechanics can be added?
    - Dialogue changing depending on win/loss here? probably not.
        - make it a scripted defeat?
    - Should the protags have different battles?
        - So far, the story only makes since if we pick Boy in the intro scene
        - Sapphire would start around here
    - Can also just prevent the player from choosing the protag
        - One character following both POV?
        - Two characters and have a switching mechanism? This one would be a lot more fun
