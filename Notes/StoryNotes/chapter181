Norman fights Cacnea, Wingull, Volbeat, Beautifly, and Duskull
    -> The platform is rocky
    -> A cloud appears and we don't see his Pokemon

Gabby and Ty interview Norman

Cut to Mom driving the moving truck and Ruby in the back
    -> Ruby has glasses
    -> His Pokemon:
        -> Ralts: Rara
        -> Poochyena: Nana
        -> Skitty: Kiki

Truck gets stuck in mud and Mom tells Ruby to get outside and help. He refuses

Ralts uses Confusion to move the truck. 

Ruby opens back of truck to look at Hoenn.

-> Remove name choice 
    -> Ruby is the boy
    -> Sapphire is the girl

-> Add overworld sprites for Pokemon (Done, from RHH Expansion)
    -> OBJ_EVENT_GFX_SPECIES(X) 

-> How to get player to map, hide them, then play animation?
    -> warp (has to be done, as there does not seem to be a way to generate a camera in other map without the player)
        -> ON_FRAME gets checked first, so make sure it does not fire straight away with CUTSCENE_STATE 0
        -> Use ON_WARP or ON_TRANSITION to call the setup and set the CUTSCENE_STATE to 1
        -> Now the frame after the setup is finished, ON_FRAME will fire the animation
    * turns out this is basically what was done in VerdanturfTown_BattleTentBattleRoom_MapScripts, not sure whats the difference between applying the set_invisible movement vs hideobject though

-> For the truck animation, will have to use Task_HandleTruckSequence or figure out a way to use the gFieldCallback
