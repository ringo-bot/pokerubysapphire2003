Sapphire arrives in Rustboro city and heads to the gym
    - The gym is actually a lecture hall

Gabby and Ty discuss the events outside of Rustboro hospital

Roxanne, the schools honors student alumnus
    - Sapphire challenges her, but she needs to pass a test first

Sapphire can't read, but she gets a perfect score

Roxanne uses Nosepass with Magnet Pull to trap Rono

Ruby gets found in the sea (route 105) by Peeko and the sailor Briney

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will have to add a hospital to the city? or repurpose the Pokecenter

Instead of a cutscene, maybe make Gabby and Ty have some dialogue Sapphire gets to eavesdrop on?

Change the language of the test in game?

The fight goes into more detail later
