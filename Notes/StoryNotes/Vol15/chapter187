They enter the outskirts of Petalburgcity
    - There is a sign warning of earthquakes and landslides
    - later on, Ruby falls into the ocean
    - it is connected to Sea Route 105
    
They look at pokemon in the forest
    - Volbeat, Illumise, Linoone, Surskit, Kecleon

Wally wants the Kecleon, they chase it to the edge of Route 105
    - Ruby lets him use Rara to attack it
    - Wally gives Ruby a PokeNav

A landslide occurs and Rara is left with Wally, while Ruby falls into the ocean

Wally wakes up in his home, carried by Rara, and there a bus for Verdanturf Town

We see at the end, Sapphire has:
    - Chic F (Torchic) Lv 15
    - Rono M (Aron) Lv 29
Ruby has:
    - Nana F (Poochyena)
    - Kiki F (Skitty)
    - Mumu M (Mudkip)

The "Canon" pokemon teams will probably be left as is and not influence the player's pokemon team
    - the pokemon will be obtainable somewhere though

Route 104 will need to have some No Trespassing forest added somewhere
    - Probably to the bottom of Petalburg City, as that would also allow an easy connection to route 105 to the left
    - Could also have a portal in the bottom right corner of original route 104 
    - Is it possible this forest is the Petalburg Woods?
        - But it is too far from the shore line of route 104 into route 105
        - unless a map is added to connect Petalburg woods into an extension of route 104 to the left
        - A river crossing dry land is more interesting than a map that is just water
        - Route 104 also has to be expanded for later chapters
