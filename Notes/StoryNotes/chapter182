Birch is doing fieldwork, looking at a Wurmple on a tree
    -> It evolves into a Silcoon instead of a Cascoon
    -> Gets a call from Norman about the gym appointment and family moving in
    -> Mightyenas sneak up on him

At home, Ruby is unpacking
    -> Throws running shoes from Dad into trash 
    -> He retrieves the shoes then runs away and encounters Birch
    -> Dodges and admires the Mightyena attacks before runnning away
    -> His rocket shoes send him off a cliff

Ruby gets saved by a "pokemon" covered in grass before passing out
    -> Nana licks him then he Wakes up and gets a call from Birch
    -> The "pokemon" talks to Ruby and suprises him; it gets bite by Nana
    -> The "pokemon" is Sapphire and her Torchic, Chic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Theres definitely no sprite for the wild Sapphire design in Emerald 
    -> Will learn how to create and add custom sprites
    -> Also need to add metatiles/new tilesets

-> Should the Rocket shoes be different from Running shoes?
    -> Similar to a dash ability?

-> Previously added an escape rope to Brendans room
    -> Set the escape rope warp to behind his house?
    -> Instead of escape rope, have an event at the window?
    -> Should have the shoes in the trash as a pickup

-> "Floating" and "Falling" animations?
    -> needed for the truck last chapter and in this one
    -> "Falling" has something similar in the Desert Tower
    -> "Floating" ?

-> Will have to add a Cave area somewhere near the start of the game
    -> Where/How far do Birch and Ruby get chased?
    -> In the next few chapters, Ruby passes Route 101 to get to Oldale Town
        -> This leaves only space to add something to the right or left of Route 101
        -> How are cliffs supposed to be mapped?

-> New area should be partially Mightyena territory 
    -> Grass: Mightyena, Seviper
