Perspective shift to Sapphire
    - day time, no indication of time relative to Ruby

Outskirts of Petalburg city, route 104
    - huge fountain with statue of Pelliper
    - circular park area

There's a crowd watching Sapphire trying to save a Pokemon stuck in the fountain
    - Gabby and Ty are recording
    - the pokemon is some old man's, and it got sucked into the fountain through the grate

Sapphire sniffs out the pokemon and has Rono eat the pillar
    - the fountain sprays water everywhere
    - the pokemon is Castform
    - Chic warms it up
    - the man is the president of Devon Corporation, Stone

Gabby and Ty try to interview her
    - she jumps away
    - Gabby notices the cut intake valve

Three aqua members disguised as waterworks communicate with Aqua leader
    - they shed their clothes and reveal the aqua outfits

Sapphire sniffs out their ambush of Lotad, Carvanha, Sharpedo

Dynamic water tiles on the map for the fountain?
    - Mission to repair the fountain later on?

Outfits for Aqua members?
    - Not high priority
